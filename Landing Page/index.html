        <h1>Thor – The God of Thunder</h1>
        <p>
          From the skies of Asgard to the battlefields of Midgard, Thor wields
          his mighty power with courage and honor. Protector of realms, son of
          Odin, and bearer of lightning — he stands as the guardian of gods and
          men alike.

        <h1>Who is Thor?</h1>
        <p>
          Thor Odinson is the Norse God of Thunder, one of the most powerful
          beings in the Nine Realms. Known for his unmatched strength and
          indomitable spirit, he is a warrior who defends Asgard and Earth from
          forces of chaos. With his hammer in hand, he channels the storm itself
          — a symbol of both fury and protection. His heart, though forged in
          battle, beats for justice, honor, and those he loves.

        <h1>Mjolnir</h1>
        <p>
          Forged in the heart of a dying star, Mjolnir is Thor’s legendary
          hammer — a weapon of immense power that grants him command over
          lightning and the ability to soar through the skies. Only those deemed
          worthy can lift it.

        <h1>Stormbreaker</h1>
        <p>
          Born from the forge of Nidavellir, Stormbreaker is an axe-hammer
          hybrid capable of summoning the Bifröst and channeling the full fury
          of the storm. It symbolizes Thor’s rebirth and unshakable resolve.

        <h1>Gungnir</h1>
        <p>
          The spear of Odin and a symbol of Asgardian royalty, Gungnir
          represents divine authority and unmatched precision. Though not Thor’s
          main weapon, it reminds him of his lineage and the power of
          leadership.
